Almost everything Iâ€™m wearing here (and most of my closet) is from Grailed, an online marketplace where you can find
high-end, pre-owned, and limited edition fashion pieces.

Why Grailed? Itâ€™s all about sustainable fashion and discovering rare finds at a fraction of the original price.

Since Iâ€™ve spent way too much time on Grailed, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to put my newly minted Data Science skills to use.
Over the past year in the HSE University AI Masterâ€™s program, Iâ€™ve been learning how to build full-cycle ML services.
So I decided to predict the selling prices of items on Grailed â€” from scraping the data to deploying and monitoring the
model.

Let me know what you think! And hey, if youâ€™re from Grailed â€” Iâ€™m totally open to being hired. ðŸ˜‰
