    # Graildient Descent: Predicting Sold Prices on Grailed

    > **TL;DR:** Iâ€™m scraping listings from Grailed and building an ML service to
      predict item sold prices. Stay tuned for updates!

    This is me throwing fits:

    Almost everything Iâ€™m wearing here (and most of my closet) is from
    [Grailed](https://www.grailed.com/), an online marketplace where you can find
    high-end, pre-owned, and limited edition fashion pieces.

    Why Grailed? Itâ€™s all about sustainable fashion and discovering rare finds at a
    fraction of the original price.

    Since Iâ€™ve spent way too much time on Grailed, I figured it was the perfect
    opportunity to put my newly minted Data Science skills to use. Over the past year in
    the HSE University AI Masterâ€™s program, Iâ€™ve been learning how to build full-cycle
    ML services. So I decided to predict the selling prices of items on Grailed â€” from
    scraping the data to deploying and monitoring the model.

    Let me know what you think! And hey, if youâ€™re from Grailed â€” Iâ€™m totally open to
    being hired. ðŸ˜‰
